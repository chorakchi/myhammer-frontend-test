## MyHammer Frontend coding challenge 
 
Create a responsive two-panel overview page in Angular. The attached jobs Json-File should be loaded with an HTTP-Request. Inside of the first panel, render a list of all the “active” jobs. Once the user clicks on a job item from the list, show detailed information of the selected job on the second panel. The code should be tested with Karma and/or Protractor. Feel free to decide which information needs to be displayed in job item and which in job detail view. Using libraries like Bootstrap 4 or Angular Material is a plus. 
 
## Handing in your results 
	
We care about high quality and well tested code that is easily maintainable, please make sure that the code you submit is working and tested as this is more important than finishing the whole task. When you hand in your code please describe in a short README how it should be executed.  In case the code is not completely finished: please describe the open tasks that still need to be done and a rough estimation on how long you would need to finish them. Please share your project on github or similar public repository, if you do not have an account send us a compressed file through https://wetransfer.com/ or any other sharing service.
